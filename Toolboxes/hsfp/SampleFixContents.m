%   This program was developed to be utilised in my MSc Dissertation. 
%   The HSFP toolbox is used in portfolio optimisations for a variety of 
%   portfolios consisting of different combinations of asset classes. 
%   The functions come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

%
% General information.
%   This toolbox houses funtions used to generate flexible probabilites
%   in the HSFP framework developed by Meucci (see references below). 
%
% General Functions:
%   xxxMainFNxx - xxxxxxx 
%   rw_probs    -  facilitates the calculation of the Time-conditioned 
%                      probabilities used in the HS-FP framework.
%                      It uses window lengths specified in number of mnths
%                      to generate the sequence of normalised Prs. 
%                      Default window length = 60 mnths (5 yrs).
